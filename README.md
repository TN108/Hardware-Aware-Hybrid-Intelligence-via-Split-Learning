## 📖 Overview

A practical implementation of **split learning** for resource-limited edge devices, specifically targeting bandwidth constraints. This project demonstrates a distributed ML system that splits a CNN between an Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense (client) and a Raspberry Pi (server).

The Arduino runs initial convolutional layers locally, generating compressed feature maps transmitted over Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). The Pi processes these features through remaining network layers for final classification.

### Why Split Learning?

Edge AI deployment faces critical trade-offs:

| Approach | Problem |
|----------|---------|
| **Local Inference** | Resource-constrained devices can't run full models |
| **Cloud Offloading** | High bandwidth, power consumption, privacy risks, latency |

**Split Learning** intelligently partitions neural networks across devices, combining the benefits of both approaches.

## ✨ Features

- 🎯 **83.40% accuracy** on binary classification (dog vs. not-dog)
- 📉 **92.9% bandwidth reduction** vs. raw image transmission
- 🔒 **Privacy-preserving**: Raw visual data never leaves the device
- 📦 **4KB feature tensors** transmitted instead of full images
- ⚡ **Real-time inference** with BLE bidirectional communication
- 🔧 **TinyML ready**: Runs on devices with <1MB SRAM

## 🚧 Challenges & Solutions

### 1. Hardware Conflict
**Problem**: Arduino can't run camera and BLE simultaneously  
**Solution**: Sequential workflow - capture → compute → disable camera → transmit

### 2. BLE Instability
**Problem**: Frequent connection drops during transmission  
**Solution**: Implemented retry logic, connection parameter tuning, checksum verification

### 3. Memory Constraints
**Problem**: 256KB SRAM limits computation complexity  
**Solution**: Simplified feature extraction, careful buffer management, streaming processing

### 4. Model Incompatibility
**Problem**: Initial Pi model expected raw images, not feature tensors  
**Solution**: Trained custom ServerNet accepting 8×4×4 feature tensors as input

## 🔮 Future Work

- [ ] **Exact Model Deployment**: Port trained weights to Arduino (currently approximated)
